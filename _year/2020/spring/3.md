# Operators in C++

Wondering what an operator is?

An **operator** is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform **specific mathematical or logical manipulations**. We have a lot of built-in operators in C++.
An **operand** is a data or variable on which the operation is to be performed on.

#### The following are some types of operators in C++:

- Arithmetic operators.
- Relational operators.
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators.
- Assignment operators.
- Special operators
- Conditional operators

## Arithmetic operators.
### Assignment (=)
```cpp
NUM1=6
NUM2=3
```


### Addition (+)
This operator adds two numbers.
```cpp
int NUM1 = 5
int NUM2 = 4
int Total = NUM1 + NUM2  
```


```cpp

```
-

This operator subtracts the second number or operand from the first.
```cpp
int NUM1 = 5
int NUM2 = 4
int Total = NUM1 + NUM2  
```

NUM1-NUM2=3

*

Multiplies both numbers or operands.
```cpp
int NUM1 = 5
int NUM2 = 4
int Total = NUM1 + NUM2  
```

NUM1*NUM2=18

/

Divides numerator by de-numerator.
```cpp
int NUM1 = 5
int NUM2 = 4
int Total = NUM1 + NUM2  
```

NUM1/NUM2=2

%

Modulus operator and returns the remainder of an after-integer division.
```cpp
int NUM1 = 5
int NUM2 = 4
int Total = NUM1 + NUM2  
```

NUM1%NUM2=0

++

Increment operator increases integer value by one.
```cpp
int NUM1 = 5
int NUM2 = 4
int Total = NUM1 + NUM2  
```

NUM1++=7

--

Decrement operator decreases an integer by one.
```cpp
int NUM1 = 5
int NUM2 = 4
int Total = NUM1 + NUM2  
```

--NUM2=2

Relational operators

Operator

Description

Example

==

Means equal to

2==3 returns 0(false)

!=

Means not equal to

2!=3 returns 1(true)

>

Means greater than

2>3 return 0(false)

<

Means less than

2â™¥ returns 1(true)

>=

Means greater than or equal to

2>=3 returns 0(false)

<=

Means less than or equal to

2<=3 return 1(true)

Logical operators

&&

It is called the logical AND operator. If both operands are true then the condition becomes true.

For example, my book is both red and big, with is true (because and meets both conditions

NUM1&&NUM2 is false

||

It is called the logical OR operator. The condition is true if one among the two operands is true

(NUM1||NUM2)

Is true

!

It is called the logical not operator. If the condition is true the not operator makes false.

!(NUM1&&NUM2)is true.

## Bitwise operators(&/\|)

Bitwise AND | Bitwise OR
x&y | x\|y
