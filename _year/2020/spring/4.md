# Constants and Keywords

A constant is an element of a program whose value can not be changed at the time of execution and they are called literals. It may be an int, a float or char data type.

## Using constants in a program

There are two ways of using constants in C++ program.

- Using `const` keyword

- Using `#define` preprocessor.

### Using `#define` preprocessor.

```cpp
#define variable value
#define WIDTH 34
```

### Using `const` keyword

You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type.

```cpp
const type variable = value;
const int WIDTH = 34;
```

A keyword is a word whose meaning is already defined by compiler. These keywords cannot be used as variable name.

Some keywords are given below:

    1. `default`
    2. `float`
    3. `register`
    4. `struct`
    5. `volatile`
    6. `break`
